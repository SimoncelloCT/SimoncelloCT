### Hi there 👋

### Who am I?
I'm Simone Scionti, a software engineer who started developing iOS apps at the age of 15. I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Catania.

### What have I done?
Over the years, I've worked as an iOS Engineer and Backend Software Engineer, both in companies and as a freelancer. My background includes a mix of cloud knowledge, particularly with AWS, and iOS native development. Additionally, I have some experience working with Angular, which I enjoyed thoroughly!

### What am I currently working on?
At present, I have decided to follow my main passion and focus on mobile development. As a result, I have returned to iOS development, and for the past few years, I've been studying and utilizing Flutter for work purposes. <br> 
Recently, I've taken the initiative to improve my Github account, as I hadn't utilized my personal one during my previous experiences (yes, I know, it's not a good thing 😩). <br> Nevertheless, there's always time to improve, and I believe it's never too late to start🚀 

### My passions
Apart from Computer science, I'm passionate about motorsports 🏍  and music 🎶. <br>
I've done motocross for several years and I play the 🎹 and the 🎸 in my free time
